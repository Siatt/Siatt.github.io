# About
### Hello
My name is Lucas Sj√∂qvist and currently studying at Linnaeus University Kalmar. 

This site was made with jekyll and the standard theme minima. There has been some changes to the thems and some implementations to add to the theme.

The humans files which contains documentation can be found in the footer.
