# What is a static site generator
A static site generator is way to convert source files to static html pages. 

You make templates/layouts and fill them with content. Then you use your static site generator of choice in my case jekyll and it will generate staic html pages for you. Which you then can host on web servers like git hub, which this site uses.

# Usage
Static sites are perfect for smaller websites, like a blog or single page websites. It's easy to setup and faster then a normal dynamic website, on top of that it's also much safer then a dynamic webiste since they cant really "hack" the website directly. 

A larger website would not work as well with the use of a static site generator. Since its more focused on small websites. Big sites would have increase build time with all the pages needed to build.

And with a static site generator like jekyll there are plenty of finished themes and plugins for use. Which makes it even easier for someone to create a website, if they dont want to focus so much on the design.

# My thoughts
I find jekyll and the idea of static site generators really fun and easy to use. Jekyll really helps prevents oneself from breaking the DRY rule, with layouts. The need to only change a tag on one html file and see the result on all pages is really nice.
